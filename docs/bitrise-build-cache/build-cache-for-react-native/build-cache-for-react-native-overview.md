Bitrise Build Cache for React Native speeds up your CI builds by caching native compilation artifacts across builds. It covers all three native build systems used in a React Native project:

- **Gradle**: Android build outputs (compiled classes, resources, dex files) are cached via Bitrise's remote build cache.
- **Xcode**: iOS compilation results are cached via Bitrise's remote build cache (the same backend used for Gradle and Bazel).
- **C++ native modules**: Compiled native bridge code and third-party native modules are cached via `ccache`, with cache entries shared across builds through Bitrise's remote build cache.

By caching native compilation outputs, subsequent CI builds can skip recompiling unchanged native code. This is especially effective for React Native projects where the native layer changes infrequently compared to the JS layer.
